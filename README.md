# Swarmed
Swarmed is a GameMaker Studio 2 project heavily inspried by the game <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/30724622774931-Swarm-Operation-Anima-Squad-Game-Mode-Guide">Swarm</a> but reimagined in a 2D 16-bit pixel art style. 

## Important Note
The sprite assets in this repository have been deleted to protect the copyrights of the artists. The game will still compile and run, but will be visually broken.

## Gameplay Features
- Enemy AI with pathfinding and obstacle avoidance
- A final boss that appears after defeating enough enemies
- Different usable items to help defeat enemies
- Mini-games in levels that grant big bonuses
- Minimap that shows the current positions of the player, all enemies and objectives
- Various types of upgrades obtained through leveling up or through the in-game store


## Installation
A live web demo is currently available at https://bradpeng.ca/swarmed/. 

To run the game on a Windows machine, you can either download and run the installer [Windows_Launcher.zip](https://github.com/BradPeng/Swarmed-Release/blob/main/Windows_Launcher.zip) or directly run the game by downloading and extracting the [Game_001.zip](https://github.com/BradPeng/Swarmed-Release/blob/main/Game_001.zip) file and running the Swarmed.exe file. You may get a warning from your computer's antivirus software, but I promise the file is safe to run.
